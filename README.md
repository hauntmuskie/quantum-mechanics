## Game Descriptions

### Schrödinger's Cat Game (Schrodinger's Cat Experiment)

In the Schrödinger's Cat Game, you will embark on a quantum journey with Schrodinger's famous thought experiment. You find yourself in a peculiar situation where a cat is enclosed inside a box along with a vial of poison. According to quantum mechanics, until you open the box to observe the cat, it exists in a superposition of both alive and dead states. Your task is to decide the fate of the cat by opening the box.

How to Play:
- Choose a box number from 1 to 5.
- Watch the animation as you open the box and reveal the fate of the cat.
- Experience the mystery of quantum superposition and the consequences of your observation.


### Quantum Double Slit Game (Double Slit Experiment)

In the Quantum Double Slit Game, you will explore the fascinating phenomenon of wave-particle duality. Imagine sending subatomic particles, such as electrons or photons, through two narrow slits onto a screen. When unobserved, these particles exhibit wave-like interference patterns, but when observed, they behave like individual particles.

How to Play:
- Choose the type of subatomic particle (electron, photon, or neutron) to send through the double slits.
- Observe the particle behavior on the screen.
- Toggle the observer effect on and off to see how observation affects the outcome.
- Experience the intriguing world of quantum mechanics and its impact on particle behavior.
